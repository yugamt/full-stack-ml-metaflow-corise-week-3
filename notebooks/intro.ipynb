    "## Why the Cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're asking \"Why should I care about running ML on the cloud?\", that's a great question. One answer is scalability: It’s like a huge massive laptop. And not only that, but infinitely many huge massive laptops at your fingertips!\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever had a Pandas dataframe that runs out of memory because maybe you have 16GB on your laptop. Sure, you could restructure your code to do it differently, or use a smaller dataset, but there’s a better way. What if I told you that you could press a button and get more memory installed on your laptop in seconds - that’s essentially what the cloud gives you!\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, a cloud-based workstation can pay big dividends when it comes to security, operational concerns, scalability, and interaction with production deployments."
